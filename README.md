# Blogs-RESTfulAPI
This is a RESTful API created to manage Blogs. Each blog item has a title and content field. For the "/posts" route you can (GET, POST, DELETE),PATCH) Posts. For a specific Blog you can (GET,PUT,PATCH,DELETE) at "Posts/:postid".

To run this you can download the files and can use software such as POSTMAN to test out the API. To run the files on a server, you need to download the files and in the source directory run "npm i" and then "node app.js" to run the server on localhost:3000.
